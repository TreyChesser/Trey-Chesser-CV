  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>Welcome to my website! I am a 3rd year biomedical engineering student at the University of Florida. I am currently looking for an internship
   for this upcoming summer that deals with using computers and software in various ways to solve the medical challenges of today. It is my belief that today's
 computational devices have a great deal of potential when it comes to solving modern day medical problems, and it's just a matter of finding the right way to incorporate
 these technolgies. I stand by this belief so much so that I have taken action to educate myself on iOS app development and
web development in order to be capable of making necessary biomedical software as it pertains to a poential iPhone app or web app. Proof of my efforts in the area of app development can be seen through
<b><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/narly-fall/id1573608425">Narly Fall</a></b> on the Apple App Store, and proof of effort pertaining to web development can be seen through the creation of this website.</p>
